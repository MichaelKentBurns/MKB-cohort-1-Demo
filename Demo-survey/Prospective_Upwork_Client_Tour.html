        <h2 id="about">About This Demo Site</h2>
        <p>
          We developed this demo site to showcase our technical skills and
          collaborative efforts. It serves as a practical demonstration of our
          abilities in web development, from frontend interfaces to backend
          processing and data management.

      <div class="section">
        <h2 id="Site_tour">Site Tour</h2>
        <p><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Welcome to the Demo</a></p>
        <p>
          We invite you to open the demo page in another window and follow along
          with this tour.
        </p>
        <h3 id="contact">Contact Survey</h3>
        <p>
          The first feature we'd like you to explore is the 'Contact' survey:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the survey page.</li>
          <li>Fill out the form with your details and comments.</li>
          <li>
            When asked "Would you like us to contact you?", select an option.
          </li>
          <li>Press the submit button.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>JSON Survey</h3>
        <p>
          In this field, Upon submission, the survey page queries the backend
          for a list of available surveys. When you select a survey, the
          questions are retrieved from the backend and then displayed in the
          form. After pressing the 'Submission' button, the page will generate a
          JSON file with your results, which is displayed on the page for
          demonstration purposes. You can download this JSON file and it will
          also be submitted to our backend where it is stored in the database.
        </p>
