# MKB-cohort-1-Demo
Where the MichaelKentBurns.com students in cohort-1 can demonstrate what they have learned

## About MichaelKentBurns.com
See: [https://MichaelKentBurns.com/](https://MichaelKentBurns.com/)

This site is a training site that is just getting started.

## Purpose of this repository

We just completed the first cohort of students and they are eager to put their knowledge into practice.  This repository is the home of the Upwork job that allows them to work together as a team and produce an application to collect feedback on their learning.  

## Requirements:

Work together to build out this repository with an application that will ask each of you to answer a set of questions about your learning experience.  It will present a form that identifies you as a student, and asks a series of questions.  When you fill out the form, the page will construct a json file with the results and save that file in the responses directory in your copy of this repository.  There will be additional requirements added as issues in this repository.  

## Rules:
1. Each team member will clone this repository and do their part of the work in their copy.
2. Everything done will be in response to an issue in this repository.  That is, Michael will create the first issue, and you as a team will design the solution together by creating new issues and then completing them. 
3. Before any changes can be pushed a test script should be created in the test directory and the test should be run and results left in the test/results directory.  Those files should be commited as well.
4. Every commit of any material will identify the issue by number and title that is addressed by the commit.  You may commit many times to an issue until it is complete and closed.
5. The work to be done for an issue will be described in the issue, and the team will use the issue comments to work together to agree on what needs to be done and who will do the work.  
6. After each commit and push to this original repository, the other team members should review the changes, verify the test results, and approve or suggest changes needed.
